# CarbonJS / `carbon-framework`
CarbonJS is a modular MVC framework for NodeJS based on Zend Framework which uses ExpressJS in the background. 

## Project structure
Even though CarbonJS is use-as-you-wish framework it requires that you follow very basic project structure.

```
Project root
├─ library
   └─ helpers
├─ modules
└─ views
   ├─ helpers
   ├─ layouts
   └─ scripts
```
